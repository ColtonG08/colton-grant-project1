    <h1>ART 3001</h1>
    <h2>Weekly A</h2>
    <p> This week in Internet Art, I was introduced to the programs Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
        This week we began the eraly stages of coding for our very own websites.
        I learned how to create a repositry through visual studio code and uplod that to my very own GitHub account. 
        From there we looked at an introductory into the very basics of coding and the language and writing of coding 
        in order to build our very own websites. One of the most important takeaways I learned this week was
        that when coding you must be tedious and precise when typing out your code language for example the slightest 
        error can throw the entire code off. Like when using the a tag code you must rember to close the tag with > and not />
        in order for the code to work. 
    </p>
    <p2> In addition to basic coding langague this week, we also learned how to add visual style and aesthetics
        to our website pages. We created a style.css page and connected to our repositories in order to insert visual aethteics 
        into our coding langague. Through websites, like w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com, I was able to play around creating my 
        own Frankenstein website. Using these tools, I learned how to make a button and edit text colors. This week we also learned
        how to insert images into our code using the coding langague < img src = "" />
