    <h2>Weekly A</h2><hr>

    <p> This week in Internet Art, I was introduced to the programs Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
        We began the early stages of coding for our very own websites.
        I learned how to create a repositry through visual studio code and upload that to my very own GitHub account. 
        From there, we looked at an introductory into the very basics of coding and the language and writing of coding 
        in order to build our websites. One of the most important takeaways I learned this week, was
        that when coding you must be tedious and precise when typing out your code language for example, the slightest 
        error can throw the entire code off. Like when using the a tag code you must rember to close the tag with >
        in order for the code to work. 
    </p>

    <p> In addition to basic coding langague this week, we also learned how to add visual style and aesthetics
        to our website pages. We created a style.css page and connected it to our repositories in order to insert visual aethteics 
        into our coding langague. Through websites, like w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com, I was able to play around creating my 
        own Frankenstein website page. Using these tools, I learned how to make a button and edit text colors. This week we also learned
        how to insert images into our code using the coding langague < img src = "" /> 
    </p>
    
    <div>
        <img src="./img/creativity spogebob meme.jpg" style="width:25%; height:25%;"/> 
    </div> 



    <h2>Weekly B</h2><hr> 
    

    <div class="relative">
        <!--The float property allows other inline content to "wrap-around" itself -->
        <img src="./img/meric-dagli-xxbh8ybkfvm-unsplash-scaled.webp" style="float: left; width: 375px; height:250px; margin-right: 12px"/> 
    
        <p>
            This week in Internet Art, we leanred how to position certain elements within our webpage.
    We specifically looked at how to create codes for several CSS postioning properties including: 
    <span style="color: red">relative, absolute, sticky, fixed, and static.</span> Relative positioning is positioned relative to its normal position. 
    The absolute position is positioned relative to the nearest preexisting element. The sticky positioning is positioned
    based on the scrolling position of the webpage. The fixed positoning is positioned relative to the viewpoint, in 
    which the positoning remains in the same place even if the webpage is scrolled. The positioning of the static positioning 
    element is not affected by the top, bottom, left, or right properties.
    </div>

    <div class="static">
        <p>     This week we also learned how to add more visual elements and aesthetics to our page utilizing various
            CSS style sheet codes. In the CSS styling sheet, I learned how to create borders around my text. When making
            border elements, I learned how I can apply color to the background of my border and manipulate the border to appear
            as a dashed or solid line in order to create more visual aethetics and elements within my code and html webpage.  
        </p>

    <h2>Weekly C</h2><hr> 
    

    <div>
        <h2>Flex Containers</h2>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div>This week in Internet Art, we learned how to create flex containers.</div>
            <div><h2>Flex Containers are very useful to use when creating a portfolio page of artwork for your website.</h2></div>
            <div><small>We also learned how to create css style codes in order to format and decorate flex containers.</small></div>
            <div><h4>In order to add a flex container to your portfolio page, the code to insert into your div is: class = "flex-container". </div></h4></div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div><small>Within the css style code, the flex container can be manipulated by changing the positioning of text within, the background color, text, and size of the container itself. </small></div>
            <div><h2>This week, we also had the opportunity to experiment on our own for our Five Variations and Hypertext exercise assignments.</h2></div>
            <div><h6>In experimenting, I found in w3 schools how to manipulate things like text color, alignment, positioning, and size.</h6></div>
            <div><small>The most important thing I learned this week in my experimentation with coding was that in your coding langauge you must be very organized.</small></div>
            <div><h2>div containers are essential in organizing your codes correctly and effectively.</h2></div>
